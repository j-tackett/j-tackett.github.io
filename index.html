        <p>2011-2013<br><br>My first job was seasonal work with the local baseball league, where I managed the concessions stand.

Each night, I would reconcile cash in and cash outusing a double entry accounting system. Concessions net profit increased from -$300 in 2011 to over $10,000 in 2013.</p>
